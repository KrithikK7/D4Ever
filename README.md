- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Tools**: Content management with inline editing capabilities for admin users

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Wouter** for lightweight routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Radix UI** for accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** component library

### Backend
- **Node.js** with TypeScript
- **Express.js** for API server
- **PostgreSQL** database (Neon serverless)
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database queries
- **Passport.js** for authentication

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 20 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** database (or access to a Neon database)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd kdrama-journal
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages for both the frontend and backend.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if not already present) and add your database connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

**For Replit Users:**
If you're running this on Replit, the database is automatically provisioned and the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is already set. You can skip this step.

### 4. Initialize the Database

Push the database schema to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This command uses Drizzle Kit to create all necessary tables in your database.

### 5. Seed Sample Data

Populate the database with sample K-Drama journal entries:

```bash
npx tsx server/seed.ts
```

This will create:
- 2 user accounts (admin and reader)
- 5 chapters covering different seasons
- 7 sections with various moods and themes
- Multiple pages with embedded images
- Beautiful K-Drama inspired content

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your Replit URL if using Replit).

## Default Login Credentials

After seeding the database, you can log in with these accounts:

### Admin Account
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Capabilities:** Full access to content management, analytics, and admin tools

### Reader Account
- **Username:** `reader`
- **Password:** `reader123`
- **Capabilities:** Read access to all content with progress tracking

## Available Scripts

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Database
- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes to the database
- `npx tsx server/seed.ts` - Seed the database with sample data

### Production
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server

## Database Schema

The application uses five main tables:

### Users
- Stores user accounts with role-based access control
- Roles: `admin`, `reader`, `guest`

### Chapters
- Top-level content organization
- Each chapter has a title, description, and order

### Sections
- Sub-divisions within chapters
- Contains mood, tags, thumbnail, and order

### Pages
- Individual content pages within sections
- Supports embedded content via `[embed:URL]` syntax

### Reading Progress
- Tracks user reading behavior
- Records completion status and last read timestamp

## Embedded Content

The application supports embedded content in journal pages using the following syntax:

### Images
```
[embed:https://example.com/image.jpg]
```

### Instagram Reels/Posts
```
[embed:https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID]
```

The content renderer will automatically detect and display these embeds appropriately.

## Customization

### Changing Colors
The color theme is defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. You can customize the K-Drama color palette:

```typescript
colors: {
  kdrama: {
    thread: "#DC143C",
    sakura: "#FFB7C5",
    lavender: "#E6E6FA",
    // ... more colors
  }
}
```

### Adding New Fonts
Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts in `client/index.html`. The application uses:
- **Nanum Myeongjo** for headings
- **Noto Sans KR** for body text

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in the environment variables
- Check that your PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
- Run `npm run db:push` to ensure the schema is up to date

### Port Already in Use
The dev server will always respect an explicit `PORT` environment variable (required on hosts like Replit).  
When `PORT` is **not** set, it now starts at `5000` and automatically searches for the next open port (up to 10 tries), so you rarely have to do anything manually.

To force a specific port, set it in your `.env` file or inline when running the command:

```bash
PORT=5050 npm run dev   # macOS/Linux
```

```powershell
$env:PORT=5050; npm run dev   # Windows PowerShell
```

### Build Errors
- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Clear the build cache: `rm -rf dist`
